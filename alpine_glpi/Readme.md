# GLPI implementation in Docker

This is a docker container that runs GLPI 10.0.11. Included in this repo you will also find a docker compose file
that starts both the glpi container and the database instance (mariadb)

Everything is configured to the point that you can just run docker compose up and you will have a glpi instance with the default configuration: default admin credentials *glpi / glpi*
