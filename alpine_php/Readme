# HTTPD/PHP based on alpine linux

This container is implementing a webserver with php. It uses apache/httpd for the webserver
and the php packages offered by the alpine distribution.

Apart from httpd/php it is installing some other usefull tools

	apk add \
	net-tools \
	tcpdump \
	ca-certificates \
	iproute2 \
	shadow \
	wget \

The alpine container starts httpd as root, and after that it starts the child processes as "apache" user
which has uid 100.
Lets modify that uid gid to 1000:1000

 	usermod -u 1000 apache && \
	groupmod -g 1000 apache
