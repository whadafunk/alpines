I've tried to build an image with all php modules compiled with the official tools from the official php container from DockerHub
Unfortunatelly the official php image based on alpine doesnt package the webserver. You only have the php cli.

I thought I can install the apache webserver and the php_module of apache, but there is a problem:

The apache php module sees only the core php module, and not the rest of them; all the compiled-in modules.

It was a bit of work to solve the dependencies and build all the modules, but I don't have the time to investigate this issue anymore.
Maybe is something about the paths where the php modules are installed. 

If you manage to solve this issue..., good for you


cheers,


Daniel
